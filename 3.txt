Cristiano Ronaldo is, without question, one of the greatest footballers of all time. He's won everything there is to win at club level across spells at Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus, along with a European Championship in Portugal colours, while breaking almost every scoring record in the books.

After earning his fifth and now almost certainly last Ballon d'Or in 2017, Ronaldo told France Football: "I'm the best player in history, in the good moments and the bad ones. I respect everyone's preferences, but I've never seen anyone better than me. I have always thought that. No footballer can do the things I can. There's no player more complete than me."
